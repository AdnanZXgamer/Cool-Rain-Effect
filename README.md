# Cool Rain Effect

## Overview
This project generates a visually satisfying rain effect that interacts with the outline of objects in an image. Inspired by a Twitter GIF, the effect simulates rain hitting an object's silhouette, with droplets flowing down edges dynamically.

## Features
- Upload any image, then an outline will be automatically detected
- Generate rain particles that interact with the detected edges
- Customize background and rain colors
- Fine-tune rain behavior in the advanced settings


## Tips for Best Results
- Use high-contrast images for more dramatic effects
- Experiment with different settings in the Advanced Tab
- Try various image types to see unique rain outline styles
